##### Background
## Designing for Tomorrow

Anyone who works in tech knows the industry has taken a beating in recent years for its perceived lack of morals and careless culture of “move fast, break things.” Companies are starting to realise how much damage has been done to labor markets, privacy, and mental health – and look at how to do things differently going forward.

As designers, we have a huge role to play in bringing about this cultural change. And to see why, just look at the evolution of design as a profession. Digital designers started out as artistically-inclined, CSS-writing engineers. But increasingly, designers have come to embody the voice of the user and strive for what Don Norman dubbed “user-centered design.”
